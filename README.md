SMOTE LOGISTIC BLENDING Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Chronic Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Prediction with Correlated Feature Selection

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that impacts women of reproductive age, is a prevalent condition that affects between 5% and 20% of females globally. The ovaries develop many cysts, which leads to polycystic ovarian syndrome. A cyst resembles a bag that contains fluid, air, or any other substance. One way to diagnose PCOS is by identifying its characteristic features, such as irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. These features serve as the primary indicators of PCOS. However, the diagnosis can be challenging, as these features can vary in severity and presentation. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and reliable methods for predicting PCOS. Over the past few years, the field of machine learning (ML) has shown great potential for predicting PCOS. ML algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that are not easily discernible by human experts. In this study, we aimed to develop an ML model for predicting PCOS based on demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters. We collected data from Kaggle that included information on age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length, follicle-stimulating hormone, hair growth, etc. We used this data to train several traditional ML and ensemble algorithms. Among the traditional machine learning algorithms evaluated for predicting PCOS, Logistic Regression emerges as the best, boasting the highest accuracy of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.90. With a remarkable accuracy rate of 91%, Logistic Regression demonstrates its ability to correctly classify PCOS cases. The high AUC value of 0.90 indicates its strong discriminative power in distinguishing between PCOS and non-PCOS instances. These results establish Logistic Regression as the optimal choice for accurate and reliable PCOS prediction. In ensemble algorithms, the blending algorithm outperforms other ensemble learning methods for predicting PCOS, with an accuracy of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.90. It demonstrates a balanced precision and recall of 0.88, highlighting its ability to accurately identify positive cases. The Blending algorithm is the top choice for reliable and accurate PCOS prediction. Our findings suggest that SLB (SMOTE LOGISTIC BLENDING) hybrid ML algorithms can be used as a tool to predict PCOS and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Further studies are needed to validate our results in larger and more diverse populations.
